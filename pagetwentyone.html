                The Archangel Blade:
            </h2>
            <p>
                You decided to investigate the rest of the chamber. <br>
                You decided to take a closer look at the statue that did not have a placard for its name. 
                As you inspected the statue, you noticed an indentation of where the placard should be. <br>
                You found a small space within and pushed a button. From the statue's chest, a blade pops out. 
                The blade in question has a drill like design with the handle wrapped in leather. 
                A note that was on it states it is an Archangel blade. <br>
                You wonder why it was hidden in the statue. But you feel you have a connection to this blade.  
                          
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Who does this blade belong to, and why do you have a connection to it?
            </p>
