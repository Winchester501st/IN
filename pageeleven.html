                The Axial Mundi:
            </h2>
            <p>
                When you crossed on through the door, the entire scenery changed. What you see is a long road ahead. <br>
                The scenery looks as if you're back on earth, but you also know this doesn't feel like home, so it must mean you're still in heaven. <br>
                You then hear this loud screeching noise in your head as if some is trying to speak to you, but you can somehow clearly make out what it is saying. <br>
                “Follow the Axial Mundi, follow the path” the voice said. Is this what it is called. <br>
                Is as if you have no choice but to follow this path, but you feel this voice is trying to mislead you.       
                
            </p>
            <p>
                What decision shall you make?
            </p>
