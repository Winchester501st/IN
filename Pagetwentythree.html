                The Garden:
            </h2>
            <p>
                You continued the path, and once more the scenery changed. 
                This time, your scenery looks like to be a beautiful garden. <br>
                You have made it to your destination it seems like. <br>
                You also remember this garden from back home. It is a garden you visited while in grade school. <br>
                You encountered what look like to be angel that has 12 wings! 6 of them being white while the other 6 black. <br>
                “You've made it my son” the angel said. <br>
                As you stepped closer, you realized it's your father! But how could that be? What about mother? Was she human? <br>
                “Son, I'm here to train you to fight against both heaven and hell, for it is time for them to end. You are the reason I left Heaven so I could protect you.”   
                          
            </p>
            <p>
                You made it to the Garden, but what over choices were there before getting here?
