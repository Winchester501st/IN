                “My, you have come this far human. I'm amazed you have absorbed the angelic grace that was in the vial back there. 
                My name is Michael, commander of Heavens armies, and I shall be staking you with me” the being said. <br>
                You asked what grace is and why is Michael taking you. <br>
                “Grace is energy, it powers us angels and gives us all sorts of abilities. It's what makes us different from humans. And you now have joined our ranks. 
                Am I'm taking you with me to help us win this war against hell”.
