                Through the Pearly Gates:
            </h2>
            <p>
                As you walk through the pearly gates, what stands before you are a long pearly hallway. <br>
                As you walk through the hallway, you've noticed all the doors seem to have some placards on them that detail what they are. <br>
                One door indicates a birth and death statistics office, another states it is a grand library. <br>
                You've also noticed that it seems like you are being followed. Is someone keeping track of you for a reason? <br>
                Nevertheless, you are unable to do anything about it since you're unarmed. <br>
                You now come across two doors that stand out from the rest, a door that is full of white feathers and another with seal on it that shows winged extended out.        
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Which path shall you take?
