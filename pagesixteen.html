                Leviathans:
            </h2>
            <p>
                As you went to investigate the black liquid, more started to show up. 
                <br>It seems that it can move on its own. The black liquid then starts to take shape and form into horrendous beasts. 
                You try to run in fear, but the beasts catch up to you. You prepare yourself for combat and strike one, making a critical blow. 
                <br>You then hear, “No matter what you do, you CANNOT kill a Leviathan, the creator's first beasts”. 
                Upon hearing this revelation, you are left to wonder what you will do. 
                You have no choice but to continue to run for eternity.         
                
            </p>
            <p>
                What other choice should you have made?
