                The Wind Gate:
            </h2>
            <p>
                You have entered through the wind vortex gates and see the surroundings have begun to change. 
                As you continued forward, you saw what was in front of you, a grand chamber of some sort. 
                <br>You see a bunch of paintings and sculptures encompassing the room. As you take a closer look at these marvelous art pieces, you see that they depict angels in combat, while some depict important angels. 
                <br>Even though you can't look away at these art pieces, you must continue to move forward. As you pressed forward, you've encountered more gates in your path, one that is pearly, while the other is silver.
