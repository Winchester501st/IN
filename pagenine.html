                The Scorched Wing:
            </h2>
            <p>
                As you cross through the fire door, you've entered another room, but this room seems to be very small. <br>
                It looks like to be an ordinary room, just with the usual pearly white walls to go with it. 
                As with the combat center, it also seems to have wear to it. <br>
                But what you noticed on the ground is a scorched mark that is shaped like a wing, as if someone burned it in place. <br>
                Accompanying the mark is a pile of ashes. You look closer and notice there is a vial buried in it. <br>
                As you examine it, you feel a huge amount of energy within it as the vial contains a blue-white mist in it. <br>
                There is a note that says, “Absorb it”.         
                
            </p>
            <p>
                What decision shall you make?
            </p>
