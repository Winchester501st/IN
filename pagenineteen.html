                Gabriel:
            </h2>
            <p>
                As you continued to the room, you've encountered this majestical being in front of you. <br>
                This being has feminine features and has 6 blueish wings in total. <br>
                “My, you have come this far human. I'm amazed you have ignored the angelic grace that was in the vial back there. 
                My name is Gabriel, and I shall be staking you with me” the being said. <br>
                You asked what grace is and why is Gabriel taking you.
                “Grace is energy, it powers us angels and gives us all sorts of abilities. It's what makes us different from humans. Am I'm taking you with me to protect you from the war, trust me.” 
                          
                
            </p>
            <p>
                You wonder if what he said is true?
