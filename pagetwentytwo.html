                The Seraph's arrived:
            </h2>
            <p>
                As you try to turn back around, a group of winged beings approaches you. 
                You recognize right away that they are angels. <br>
                “We have been watching you, abomination, you are to come with us” the angels said. <br>
                Why do I need to go with them, and why am I an Abomination. <br>
                “In order to win this war against Hell, you are here to help us, but we will decide your fate after the war, for you are a Nephilim, an abomination of Heaven”. <br>
                A Nephilim, what is that? Was I never human this entire time? Just who were my parents?   
                          
            </p>
            <p>
                You have no choice but to go with them, but you wonder what other choices you were to have made differently?
