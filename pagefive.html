                The Angel Sword:
            </h2>
            <p>
                What you now have in front of you is a large sword with a blade that is shaped like a skinny triangular based pyramid with a three-pointed hilt. 
                The placard states that it was an “Angel Sword”. 
                <br>You noticed that there is an elegant design on the blade, while also noticing that there seems to be handwriting on the blade as well, but you can't seem to make out what it is saying. 
                What you do know is that you have something in your hand to protect yourself from any dangers. 
                And what you see in front of you is a fire door to go through, but you also notice that there is a mysterious black liquid nearby that seems intriguing.        
                
            </p>
            <p>
                What shall you do?
            </p>
