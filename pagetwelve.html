            <p>
                You went ahead and ignored this mysterious vial that you had picked up. You placed it back on the pile of ashes.<br>
                You try to see what else there is in this room, but you've also noticed that there is something odd. <br>
                You feel as if someone is watching your every move. But is that really the case, or you are just very cautious? <br>
                Nevertheless, you must continue your journey. You try to find if there is any way out of this room other than going back to the previous room. <br>
                Right on cue, a panel in the wall opens. 
                
            </p>
            <p>
                No other choice than to go on through.
