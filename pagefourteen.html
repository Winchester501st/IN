            </h2>
            <p>
                You listen to the voices' instructions and follow the path of the Axial Mundi. <br>
                As you continue through the path, the scenery once again changes. You recognize this scenery, it's from your childhood. <br>
                You wonder how this voice in your head knows your life. You blatantly yell, asking for answers. <br>
                The voice then responds with, “I may know your history, but the Axial Mundi scenery reflects differently for everyone.” <br>
                He knows your life, but how? On cue, the voice says,” Angels know everything about everyone's memories, now continue down the path.”

                You wonder if you should listen to him or turn back?
