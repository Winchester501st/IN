                The Host of Heaven:
            </h2>
            <p>
                As you pass through the winged door, you are astounded by what you see in front of you. A large theater-like chamber that is filled with thousands of winged beings. 
                Are these angels that you see. It's like they're gathered here for a large meeting. 
                <br>Suddenly, you hear, “Host of Heaven, we shall commence our meeting to discuss the situation of war with hell that has now taken place on Earth. 
                We are in the search for one human who has knowledge. He will be the one to turn the tide of this war for Earth. And he is here in Heaven”. 
                <br>You then remember that you wake here, since you passed on, so they are looking for you. 
                <br>All of a sudden, two guards appear behind you and capture you.         
                
            </p>
            <p>
                What other choice should you have made?
