                As you entered the portal, you were then transported to another location. You then wake up on the ground, but your surroundings feel different. 
                <br>Are you back on Earth? So, it would seem since you don't see the silver city no more. All you see is a war-torn Earth. 
                <br>You then hear a voice,” You fool, did you not read. You have allowed your curiosity to take the better of you.” 
                <br>You didn't understand what was going on. “For your foolishness, you have been banished from Heaven, as decreed by Metatron” the voice says. 
                <br>You are left to wonder what will happen next.        
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Did you make the right choice?
