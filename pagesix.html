                The Angel Blade:
            </h2>
            <p>
                You equipped yourself with what looks like a short, triangular-based pyramid-shaped blade, with a small handle. <br>
                The blade is also entirely silver, but you also notice how light and sturdy it was, meaning this was no ordinary metal you had in your hand. <br>
                You noticed there was some handwriting, but you can't make out what it was saying. But you now have something to protect yourself with. <br>
                You noticed the fire door, but it seems to have disappeared and you now come across a pearly door, 
                but you have also noticed what looks to be like water that has taken shape to form a gate.        
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Which path shall you take?
