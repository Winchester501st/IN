                Metatron:
            </h2>
            <p>
                As you try to leave the portal chamber, you encounter a blinding light. <br>
                You feel a foreboding presence in front of you. “Well done human, you have passed this test and ignored your curiosity. 
                I am Metatron, and I will be taking you with me” this presence in front of you said. <br>
                The blinding light fades away and you get a better view of Metatron. He looks to be robotic and chromed out, with mechanical wings. <br>
                You asked why he is taking you. Metatron says, “So you can help end this war and achieve my visions”.          
                
            </p>
            <p>
                You wonder if this is the right choice you've made?
