                The Statue Chamber:
            </h2>
            <p>
                As you cross on through the water gates, you've entered a large chamber, but this isn't an ordinary chamber. <br>
                You feel nothing but an overwhelming pressure in the air when you step into the chamber. <br>
                What you see in front of you are 5 large foreboding statues that show winged beings carrying weapons, except one as it seems to be partially destroyed. <br>
                Of the 5 statues, only 4 have placards that state the names of these statues. Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and on the destroyed statue, Lucifer. <br>
                One for some reason doesn't have a name on it, but the statue carries a large sword. <br>
                You have this feeling that you need to leave the room, but you feel there is more to explore.       
                
            </p>
            <p>
                What decision shall you make?
            </p>
