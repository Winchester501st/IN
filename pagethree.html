                The Fire Gate:
            </h2>
            <p>
                As you headed on through the fiery gates that were eternally ablaze, you continued to move forward, and you saw that your surroundings began to change. 
                What you now see in front of you is what looks like to be a combat center of some sort. It looks to be huge and shows that it has some wear to it. 
                <br>You investigate nearby and you seem to have found a weapons locker, but it appears to have no variety of sort. What you find before you are two weapons of choice, a long sword, and a short blade. 
                <br>It looks like both weapons have a name. The Angel sword and Angel Blade.     
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Which weapon shall you take?
