                The Beginning:
            </h2>
            <p>
                You awaken from your long nap, but you find yourself not at home but somewhere else entirely. 
                <br>All you see around you is a pearly silver city. You start thinking about how you even ended up here in the first place. 
                <br>Did someone take you by any chance while you were asleep? Or was it something else entirely? You explore your surroundings, 
                and you came across a sign that states â€œThe Silver City of Heaven. And then it hits you, you realized that you have passed on. 
                <br>You were caught in between a fight with angels and demons. But you wonder why? Are you special or something? 
                You continued to explore, and you came across two large gates, one that is on fire and one that has a vortex wind around it.

            <p>
                Which do you go through?
