                The Portal Chamber:
            </h2>
            <p>
                As you walked through the silver gate, you seemed to have entered another chamber, but different from the previous chamber you've witnessed. <br>
                What you see before you are a bunch of portals that lead to somewhere. Where do they lead? <br>
                And why are there portals in heaven? Wouldn't one assume these creatures called angels be able to teleport anywhere they want. <br>
                Nonetheless, you have this feeling that you shouldn't be in here in the first place. <br>
                You decided to investigate these portals in closer detail, and you noticed that there are placards nearby that have writing on them. <br>
                The writing that you couldn't understand earlier now seems to have partial legibility that you could potentially make out what it's saying. <br>
                It seems to say, “Only the Archangels have permission to use these portals”.         
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Do you go through the portal or leave?
